          <h1>The Girl who Dashes Off(つっぱしる女)</h1>
          <p>Coach: On your mark, get set...</p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Wow! Kona-chan, that was so amazing! You're so good at sports and I always wondered, how come you don't join a team or anything?</p>
          <p>Konata: 'Cause if I got a team and started playing sports...I'd miss all of my primetime anime shows.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Hey, Tsukasa. Which end of a chocolate cornet do you eat first?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Huh? Um, I think I started the head.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Really? So which side of this thing's the head, anyway? The fat part or the skinny?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I always thought that this end of it if the thin one was the head.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Ohh. See, I always thought that fatter meant was the head. So, why do you think that the thinner end's the head?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Doesn't it look like a seashell? (A picture of a seashell is shown) Why do you think it's the fatter end?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: I always thought it'd look more like a Caterpillar.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: A Caterpillar?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Yeah. But, when you think about it, I guess seashells are a much better image.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Um, you know...there's another way to eat it. Tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate cream on the fat end.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: (Giggles) Good idea!

        </p>
          <p>Konata: I figured you know that. You're so smart, Miyuki-san.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Well, not really. Everyone has their own way of eating one.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: How about cream puffs? How do you eat them?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Huh? How do I eat a cream puff? That's easy. It split it in half horizontally, then I take the top half and dip into the cream in the bottom part. Then, after most of the cream is gone, I start eating the bottom. I find that if I eat it that way, it keeps the cream from spurting out. And I can have equal amounts of cream and pastry in each bite.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Ohh.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: What do you do about the one that have both custard and cream? Do you have a system to eat those? Do you mix the flavors together?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: No. I don't have system for those, per se. Wait, how exactly does one mix the flavors?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Um, just asking.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: When do you eat the strawberry on a strawberry shortcake? Or a chestnut on top of a montblanc?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Let's see now. It depends on the amount of strawberries that are sandwiched between the layers of sponge cake. With the strawberries, the whipped cream in the sponge cake, I paste it so that I can get a bit in each and every bite. So, getting to the strawberry on top of the cake is always different for me.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Hmm, that's a solid move.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: When I eat it, I always save the strawberry on top for last. Sometimes, I get so full that I can't eat it. In other times, someone in my family comes along and takes it away.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: And that's why you should always eat your favorite part first.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Come to think, I never seen anyone take Kagami's strawberry away from her.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: That's Kagami for ya. She's sharp.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Here's one. Can you eat the very last bite of an ice pop without dropping it?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Wait. You drop it?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: If you don't eat it the right way...(She takes a bite of the popsicle and it falls off.)...it falls off, doesn't it?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Yes.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: How do you do it, Kona-chan?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: I suck it out the stick.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Ohh.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Or maybe you could just turn it around while you eat it like this.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, that's a good idea.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: And then, there's soft-serve ice cream which I'm not very fond now.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: What's wrong with it?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: (Nibbles on an ice cream cone) I hate how you're always left with an empty cone at the end of it.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: You're right. There's never any ice cream left. Just the cone.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: (Stuffs the ice cream in her mouth) I always try to push the ice cream further and further down into the cone as I eat it.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: But, how in the world do you do that?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: While I eat, I do a push and shove thing.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: A push and shove thing?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: You try to balance everything out, don't you?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: I suppose.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh. Here's another one. How do you eat curried rice? Do you mix the the curry with the rice?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: No, but I do try to have equal amounts of curry and rice left over for my last bite.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I like mixing it up. How do you eat it?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: It all depends on the curry. If I pour some sauce on it or drop a raw egg on top, then I mix it up.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: You put sauce on curry?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh, yeah. It's tasty.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Do you put sauce on fried eggs too?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Nope. I put soy sauce on fried eggs.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Ohh. See, when I use that, I used mayonnaise.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Mayonnaise on fried eggs. Not on hard boiled eggs?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Mm-hmm. You know, mayonnaise is good with pretty much every egg dish.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You put it on curry too?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Mm-hmm! I put mayo on white rice, and on beef bowls, it goes good with that sweet broth. Oh, and also good with chicken and egg bowls, too! You know how the chicken's the parent and the egg's the child? And how mayonnaise is made from eggs, too? I just put a little plop of it on top and I call that "The Relative Bowl".

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Hmm...

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: And I used to really hate Natto beans. But, if I put some mayonnaise 'em, I can eat 'em.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Blech. I can't imagine that.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, but the tastiest thing has to be when you put mayonnaise right on top of soft-boiled eggs.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Even the fried eggs are half cooked at my house.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Really?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Yep, that's just how my dad likes his eggs. I guess it's because they always like to suck on the yolk. So, if you fry the egg too much, then the yolk gets too hard and my dad can't suck the yolk out.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: So, how do you eat chicken skewers?</p>
          <p>Konata: What do you mean "how"?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Do you eat it right off the skewer? Or do you pull it off with chopsticks?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Let me see...when I'm alone, I'll eat it off the skewer. But, when I'm eating in public or with company, I'll use chopsticks to pull it off.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Yeah, and don't you feel weird when there's one piece left on the plate?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Yes, the last bite certainly makes things awkward at the table.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: And then it gets later and later and no one eats it.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: It gets all dry and stale and it's not looking so tasty and no one really wants to eat it. But, they don't wanna say anything. And them, the waiter comes over to take the plate and you're like "Whoa! We're still eating that!". In the end, we all go home without eating that last bite.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, that's such a waste.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I feel sorry for it. Oh! With Korean barbecue, I feel sorry for the meat that's left on the grill that turns to charcoal.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I feel sorry for it. Oh! With Korean barbecue, I feel sorry for the meat that's left on the grill that turns to charcoal.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Well, at a Korean barbecue, you're always eating and chatting at the same time. So, you get a little distracted.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: And when you're grilling beef tongue with green onions, that cooks really fast.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, you're so right. It's already done cooking by the time you flip it over, isn't it?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Wait, you flip it over?

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Huh?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You flip it over.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Mmm.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You should never flip beef tounge with green onions.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Why shouldn't I flip it?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: 'Cause if you flip it over, all the green onions on top will fall into the grill.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukino: Yeah, I guess you're right.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You don't need to flip it over at all. You roast it on one side and the heat cooks it all the way through.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I get it. I guess I'll do that from now on.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You absolutely positively never flip it.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Never flip it.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Never.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh. Which end of a chocolate cornet is the head? The fat end or the skinny end?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Such a bad boy.

        </p>
          <p>Kagami: What's with all the confinement lately? I mean, these guys and prision girls enforce them to call you "Master" and stuff? It's sick!

        </p>
          <p>Konata: I think it's about guys playing way too many dating Sims in erotic games. The master slave thing is pretty common scenario, you know.

        </p>
          <p>Kagami: Oh, yeah! Like you know all about that! Wait. You're in the 11th Grade, how do you know about erotic game scenarios?

        </p>
          <p>Unseen Voices: Lucky Star.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You're amazing. You're always at the top of the class. (Miyuki hums a question) Don't you have any questions, Miyuki-san?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: You're amazing. You're always at the top of the class. (Miyuki hums a question) Don't you have any questions, Miyuki-san?

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: I sometimes cut my finger using the veggie slicer. (She is then seen tripping over) Sometimes I trip on my feet and fall down. (She is carrying bags as she enters the train) Or a corner of my toast apple is caught in a train's door.

        </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: (Shocked) Wow.

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Whoa, hold it! Miyuki-san, those aren't called "faults". People call those "mullet points"!

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: (Sweats) Huh? Mullet points?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: Clumsy is sexy.

        </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Kona-chan, what have you been thinking this whole time?

        </p>
          <p>Konata: How come you wear glasses? I mean, you're really pretty, but you can only appeal to a tiny section of the fan base.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: (Chuckles) "Appeal to". Besides the popularity, don't glasses actually make your vision worse? How come you never switch to wearing contacts?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, well, it's a little embarrassing to admit now that I'm in high school. But, I suppose you could say...I'm afraid of contact lenses! Actually, I'm pretty scared to put anything into my eyes. I can't even open my eyes underwater.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Damn, she's a natural airhead! A total cutie pie!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Hey, isn't that Miyuki-san over there?

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Huh?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I wonder if she broke down and decided to get some contacts.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I guess she's probably better off with the glasses after all.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: That must have hurt.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: And she's that way naturally.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Kagami's staying home 'cause she's got a cold, huh?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Thankfully, I'm stupid. So, I don't have to worry about catching flus and stuff.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: (She and Konata laugh) I heard that works of a cold, but I didn't know it was the same for the flu.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I thought the flu was the deluxe version of the cold. You're saying that colds and flus are two different things?

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: I-I guess I think they're different things. Or maybe they aren't. I don't know anymore. I'm kinda confused now.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh. The difference between influenza and a cold? (Konata grunts with effort) Let me see now...influenza is a viral illness with many symptoms such as fever and muscle aches. If it's not treated, there's a risk of more serious complications. On the other hand, the symptoms of a cold are sore throat and a runny nose. And the fever doesn't run this high. Those are just a few of the symptoms to differ from the flus.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Hmm.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: So, the answer to your question, yes, they are different illnesses.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: (A storm cloud appears on her head) Oh, really?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, but then again, colds and flus do share many common traits. I guess one could say a flu is sort of a skilled up version of a cold after all.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I knew it!

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Why are you looking so serious, huh, Kona-chan?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh, it's nothin'. Just something that's been bugging me since our conversation this morning.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Huh? The one about colds and flus?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: You didn't disagree with me when I said I was stupid, did you, Tsukasa?

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Wait! It's not like that! I didn't mean...

          </p>
          <p>Mother Hiiragi: Hello, Konata-chan. Come in.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: She came by to visit my sis.

          </p>
          <p>Mother Hiiragi: Ohh. Thanks for coming to see her.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: No worries. I'll just go out.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Thanks.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Ha. Kagami sure is cute when she's sleeping, isn't she?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: How'd you get into my room?! What are you doing? Get out!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Uh, cause she's awake, you.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Huh? You came by for a visit? All the way out here to see me?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Yep, that's right.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Oh, no. I appreciate the thought, but I feel terrible if you got this thing. (Thinking) Oh, this makes me so happy. She's ao worried about me because of that new virus that's going around. I thought the only thing she cared about word games and anime, but now, this is so touchy.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: (Takes out notebooks) 'K, so, uh, I'm gonna copy that homework we got the other day. But, you don't have to get up, you cute little sleepy-facing you.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: (Raged) Out!

          </p>
          <p>Mother Hiigari: Kagami! Miyuki-chan's come over to visit you!

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: (Sighs) Okay!

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: May I come in?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Oh, I hope this isn't too much trouble.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Not at all. You should be resting, though. (Hands out flowers to Kagami) Here's a little something.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Thank you. I'm feeling a lot better now. I took some medicine, so my fever's down.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Here.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Wow! You brought me flowers and fruit. You shouldn't have. Come on, sit down.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, thank you, I will. I had thought of coming by to visit you at Izumi-san's. Unfortunately, I just couldn't seem to find any time. I'm sorry.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: No, really. It's fine.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh. I almosy forgot, I brought you the minutes from the last committee meeting.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Well, thank you.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Have a look at it when you can. But only when you're feeling up to it. There's no rush.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Hmm.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: There's bad and I have the budget requests from each club here. What else was there? Let me see now...let's see...oh! But you're not feeling well right now. I should go home so you can rest.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Now this is what a visit feels like!

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: What do you mean? What happened?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Well, you know how Konata came by yesterday? (The scene shows a Chinese house) That's what happened.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Maybe that was just Izumi-san's funny little way of showing you who she cared. Perhaps the bit with the homework with her tempted cheering you up, Kagami-san. And maybe she was trying not to wake you up, but couldn't help noticing you as you slept. And that would certainly explain how she saw you sleeping.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: I never would've thought of it that way! Is this girl a saint or something?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, I just realized. I haven't seen Tsukasa-san today.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Morning. Are you feeling any better today, sis? You need anything?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Ah, look at that. My sister isn't even sick and she's more relaxed than I am.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Well, it's not like I'm always sleeping in this late, really. Today's, like, "Spring sleep" done something or other. Oh, by the way, good morning!

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Oh, I know how that is. Lately, even I'm having trouble waking up in the morning.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Yeah, I know. And I've been so sleepy lately.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Me too. It's especially warming out today, so that doesn't help either.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Mm-hmm. Isn't it, though?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: You really can't help it.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Wasn't it warm a couple of days ago during our break?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: It was.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: When I woke up, it was just starting to get dark. I spent the whole day sleeping. Can you believe it?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: It's a good thing if you can rest up when you have the day off.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Yeah, but the thing is, I was in my pajamas all day! Oh, like today! (Chuckles)

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: (Gasps) I had no idea those were your pajamas.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, yeah. They're my jammies.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: I think they're adorable. But, they don't even look like pajamas.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: You think so?

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: Yes.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Do you think it's okay if I wear them all day?

</p>
          <p>Kagami: Geez, will someone get to the punch line already?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: It's gone up a little. No, wait! The bra that I'm wearing has underwires and extra pads! So, that's why I'm heavier today. Yeah, that's it. Yeah. I wonder how much that is in grams.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: (Thinking) It's over. I totally screwed up! I forgot I had a physical exam today, so I wore my character print underwear!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: (Thinking) I'm still short.

          </p>
          <p>Miyuki: (Chuckles)

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: How dare you are happier than the rest of us?! Damn you!

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Hey. I'm here now.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, hiya, sis.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I just thought of something. You always come here to hang out. What's the deal? Don't you have any friends from your home?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Unlike you, I had friends. Are you trying to pick a fight?!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: No, I just thought they were avoiding you as all.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Why don't you worry about yourself for a change and get to work on those social skills?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Social skills? What are you talking about? See, even though I look like this, I've got about a hundred friends. Both a social and my bargaining skills are actually pretty high. Oh, and I got to parties every night.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Huh?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: And with my allies, I strive to restore the light to the crystals, rescue the kidnapped princess, and save the world from ruin.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Wait, you're talking about a game!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh yeah, I haven't seen that guy in a while.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: What guy?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: She's talking about one of her game buddies.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Hmm, he's a warrior class character who wanted to improve his hand-to-hand combat skills. He left to train somewhere else where there's lots of monsters, but hasn't come back yet. (Mouthful) I heard from someone else when he's camping out in one of the underground caverns. I wonder if he's alright though being all cooped up down there like that. Everyone's worried about him.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: How do you get cooped up in a game?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Trust me, it happens. I don't know, but by the looks of his login info, he's been playing the game nonstop for days.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Cooped up in the real world too, huh?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Whatever. It's the same guy in both worlds.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: I always wanted to ask you guys this. How did the two of you become friends, anyway?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Tsukasa was about to be kidnapped by some big suspicious foreign dude. I just happened along saw what was going down and jumped in! I unloaded a front pinch whirlwind kick combo attack on him and rescued her from that creep.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Why does everything you talk about revert back to gaming?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Hey, I was just doing what any other skilled martial artist would've done, you know?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: I don't approve the use of hasty violence, but you did save her.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: The thing is that the foreigner was just asking me for directions. I couldn't understand what he was saying, though. And that's when Kona-chan came by.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: (Shocked) Wait, that's no good! How can you be so smug about it?!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Ooh, that's right. It's that time of year again, isn't it?

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: What are you talking about?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I just remembered that baseball season is starting soon.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Oh, do you not like watching sports and stuff, Kona-chan? I sort of figured you'd love watching sports because you're so athletic.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: If a gang goes into extra innings, it's guaranteed to totally screw up the late-night programming schedule for anime! Or even worse, they could end up cancelling the broadcast for that night.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: It sucks when something you like disappears, doesn't it?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: When do you eat the strawberry on top of a strawberry shortcake?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Why do you wanna know?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: I was just wondering if you like to save your favorites for last.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: I guess I saved my favorite stuff for the last bite. Although with strawberries, it depends.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Beef tongue with green onions cook both sides.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Beef tongue with green onions? Hmm, it cooks pretty fast, but I guess if you roast it on both sides, it'll get done quicker.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: You can't, the green onions fall off!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: You can't, the green onions fall off!

          </p>
          <p>Konata: But if you do that, the onions won't get roasted.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: But the green onions are just a topping, aren't they?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Man, you just don't get it at all.

          </p>
          <p>Tsukasa: Wait, maybe you can cook it both ways.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Oh. Which end of a chocolate cornet is the head? Is it the fat end or the skinny end?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Hmm...the fat end?

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Well, how? Guess we agree on that.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Uh, you're kidding.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Okay, so which end do you eat first?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Hmm, don't you tear off the thin end and dip it in the chocolate in the fat end?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Do you have any other friends, besides us and the ones you have in video games?

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: Oh, you actually had one.

          </p>
          <p>Konata: Yeah, but I haven't talked to her in a while. I wonder what she's up to these days. You know, I remember in our junior high yearbook, she wrote that her big dream in life was to become a maid.

          </p>
          <p>Kagami: So she was a geek too!

          </p>
          <p>Unseen Voices: Lucky Star.

          </p>
          <p>Akira: Lucky Channel! Hiya, luckies! It's time for the first ever episode of Lucky Channel. So throw your hands up in the air and say "Yay!" And a big hello to all the viewers tuning in. I'm Akira Kogami and I'll be your navigator.

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: And I'm Shiraishi.

          </p>
          <p>Akira: Who's that? Just kidding! Allow me to introduce Minoru Shiraishi. He's gonna be my number one assistant! (Imitates fanfare)

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: Yeah, well, I am Minoru Shiraishi and I will Akira-sama's assistant from now on. Howdy.

          </p>
          <p>Akira: My, my, my, you're so tense, Shiraishi-san! Come on, now, you're finally on TV. Loosen up, you big stoop-in-the-mud, you! Kitty

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: Sorry, I'm just not used to this.

          </p>
          <p>Akira: I know it's not only our first show, but we've already got bunches of letters to viewers just like you!

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: Okay, we got a letter here from a viewer in Osaka calling themselves "I Love Berry-Kou". "Dear Lucky Channel, congratulations on your first ever episode."

          </p>
          <p>Akira: Thank you, thank you!

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: "By the way, I've got a question for Akira-san. You are referred to super idol by everyone including yourself. How much money do you make as an idol? Please tell me!".

          </p>
          <p>Akira: What, I'm paid?

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: Yes. You know, this question is kinda personal, so maybe we should move on.

          </p>
          <p>Akira: Yeah, you know, what are you thinking, asking a question like that?

          </p>
          <p>Minoru: Uh, Akira-sama...

          </p>
          <p>Akira: Well, it totally depends on the job. You know, some gigs are cheap, some are really cheap. Either way, I get paod for a flat fee from the production company. So who knows how much money those guys are skimming off the top?
